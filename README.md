# Unity-Platformer-Game
 One of my first programming projects. My personal simple unity project, where I attempt to make a 2D platformer similar to something like hollow knight. It was mostly used as a place for me to play with unity and play around with some ideas and learn some stuff. This is a project I started summer 2020.
